# UFOs
The goal of this project was to create multiple filters to go through the UFO data. This will allow users to filter the data by multiple factors at once. The data table is updated by user inputs.

This project involved Javascript, CSS, and HTML to display the proper data in a web browser.

I would also look into adding the following:
 - The comments section is not filterable. It would be good to look for keywords to search the data.
 - creating a heatmap of where the activity is occuring. Using Google maps API and the locations may give us greater insight.
